Microprocessor Systems.<br><br>
TMU Laboratory Assignments.<br>
The lab assignments were done in assembly using the CodeWarrior IDE. They consist of easy applications to programs that utilizes HCS12C and HCS12D microcontrollers to perform various tasks.<br><br>
Note: The code may slightly vary for each bot, especially for the final lab. Futhermore, many of the eebots are inconsistent and broken, suffering issues with their power delivery, wheels, and sensors. Some of the eebots that have been observed to work the best are 102947, 102952, and 102955.
